Welcome to my page! Here you will know both my professional and personal interests, activities, events in my life and how I have reflected on my life so far and how I would want to live my life in the near and far future. Although I'd always want to be flexible and keep changing (as Bruce Lee says "Be like water"), there are certain things in my life that I would to keep constant and inflexible like the morals and values imbibed in me by my parents and the values that I have acquired over my approximately 25 years of living on this planet. In my younger days, I had always thought hard work and self-sacrifice were the highest of virtues and these virtues would take you far and give you success in life. Although they are very important virtues, after my years in college and my ups and downs in corporate life I've realized that it is bravery and integrity that are the most important virtues a man can acquire and hold on to for the rest of his life. 



A short story of my life so far!
======
I was born in a southern, growing metropolitan city in India called Chennai. From my mothers words, I was a naughtly, stubborn, rebellious little toddler who would take immense joy in seeing my mother's shocked face immediately after I dropped the pressure cooker weight from the third floor of the apartment building that we were living in. Apparently it gave me that sense of validation when I got her attention. Not to forget she was a very busy full-time mother of two who took care of almost all chores in the house. I vaguely remember those days I went to Pre-Kindergarten/Day Care in Chennai when the first words I spoke were in Tamil (a local state language) with my caretakers (I can't speak a word of Tamil now, although I understand most words when someone else is speaking them). My maternal grandmother would often come over to Chennai to help my mother with her work, and I remember those days when she would pick me up from the day-care and we would pass by a small convenience store during the walk on our way home and I wouldn't let her take another step in the direction of home unless she got me a specific type of candy from the store. I would hold her arm so tightly with all the strength in my body and wouldn't let her move. My father insisted that I not have any more candy as a toddler as it was affecting my teeth causing severe cavities. But I wouldn't listen and would not give up until I got my candy. My father said I displayed similar attitude with the toy shops. I was a big fan of trucks, ambulances, fire-trucks, trains, that made a lot of sound when played with. So I wouldn't let go of my dad's arm everytime we passed by the toy store until he got me the toy I wanted. I would be the happiest person in the world the moment he bought me the toy. 

We moved to Bangalore (in Karnataka, a different state) when I was 3 or 4 years old because my father got a job in the private sector. I started my upper-kindergarten here and the number of hours that we had to spend in school increased. My mom tells me that I would cry everytime my mom lets me off at school in the morning for the first few weeks of school. I remember that I was a good student and obedient individual outside home, I bonded well with my kindergarten teachers and I can still remember their faces in my head today. I would come back home from school and the first thing I would do was turn on the TV and watch a show called Oswald. I was a huge fan of the blue octopus that followed rules, was kind to everyone and was a huge star to me. I wouldn't miss that show no matter what. It wasn't long till we moved away from that apartment that we were living in and moved to a apartment flat that my father had purchased a few miles away from where we were living. This meant changing schools and adjusting a completely new environment in a short period of time. I had to make new friends in the apartment that we moved into and make new friends at the school that I changed to. To be honest I had trouble doing both. I didn't make new friends in school as most of them were speaking the local language of the state of which I didn't understand a single word (and surprisingly found it very difficult to learn in the coming years as well). But I eventually made friends with some of my classmates and focused on my studies and hobbies that my parents tried to cultivate in me. They enrolled me in Indian classical music and art classes that commenced immediately after I finished school and came back home. I wouldn't say I was good with them, I struggled in the beginning and eventually got better at both after a period of time. Over the years I also developed a huge fascination with the computer that my father had purchased for his work and personal use. He tried to get me involved with this mysterious machine by showing me some games that I could play on them. I was immediately addicted. My introduction to the internet was also through my fascination for RPG games that involved franchises that I loved like Pokemon, Digimon and Ben 10. As I spent more time on the computer in my 4th and 5th standard, my exaxm grades also started dropping. My grades were abysmally low in my 6th standard, with my grades being abysmally low in English and Hindi. This prompted my father to cutoff all electronic devices at homes that I spent a lot of my time on, be it the keypad phone, TV or the Nintendo Gameboy that I used to play on regularly (which was owned by a friendly neighbor). I later suffered from Chickenpox which I contracted from my younger sister. This was a turning point in my life. I was the most vulnerable I had ever been in my life, health wise, academics wise, and 
 
Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
