Welcome to my page! Here, you'll discover insights into both my professional and personal interests, along with updates on activities and events in my life. I also delve into reflections on my past experiences and aspirations for the future. While I strive to remain adaptable, echoing Bruce Lee's philosophy of "being like water," there are core principles I hold dear and unwavering, such as the morals instilled by my parents and the values I've cultivated over my 25 years on this planet.

The story of my life so far!
======
I was born in Chennai, and grew up in Bangalore, both bustling cities in southern India. As a little kid, I was a handful, always causing mischief. I'd find joy in surprising my busy mom, even if it meant dropping things from high places just to get her attention. My mom juggled taking care of me and my sibling along with all the household chores.

We moved to Bangalore when I was around 3 or 4 because of my dad's job. School became a bigger part of my life, and I'd cry when my mom dropped me off at school first. But I was a good student and got along well with my teachers. I was a good student throughout my school years and engaged in extra curricular activities like Art, Indian Classical Music, Table Tennis and Soccer. I was part of the doubles team that won the Inter-School Table Tennis competition in 2013. I was also amongst the *100 students* from my state (out of approx 100,000 students) that qualified for **NTSE (National Talent Search Examination)** stage 2 in the year 2015. I could solve a **Rubik's cube** in less than **20 seconds** in the year 2014.

I gave the JEE Mains examination and secured admission to an engineering college that was ranked top 10 in the country (**National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal**). My experience in college was turbulent and I certainly learned a lot of new things in a stressful manner. During my education I collaborated on research projects with labs in the CSE Department, and did a summer internship at the **Indian Institute of Science** involving the use of statistical learning techniques on medical datasets. I also worked as an intern for **Standard Chartered GBS** where I tried to work on deriving some insights from banking data. I had a short stint at **FlexiEle Consulting Services** where I worked on improving their complex human resources management software. I moved within a year to **Digital.ai** where most of my professional career development occurred and I had to go through a very steep learning curve to work with industry standard technologies, work with teams across different domains and meet very strict deadlines. I decided after a year to move to the United States to pursue a Master's degree at **Arizona State University**.

My Aspirations for life moving forward
