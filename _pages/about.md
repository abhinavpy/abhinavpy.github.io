Welcome to my page! Here, you'll discover insights into both my professional and personal interests, along with updates on activities and events in my life. I also delve into reflections on my past experiences and aspirations for the future. While I strive to remain adaptable, echoing Bruce Lee's philosophy of "being like water," there are core principles I hold dear and unwavering, such as the morals instilled by my parents and the values I've cultivated over my 25 years on this planet. In my youth, I esteemed hard work and self-sacrifice as paramount virtues, believing they guaranteed success in life. However, through my college years and corporate endeavors, I've come to recognize that bravery and integrity are the cornerstones of a fulfilling existence.

A brief of my technical experience!
======
I 

A long story of my life so far!
======
I grew up in Chennai, a bustling city in southern India. As a little kid, I was a handful, always causing mischief. I'd find joy in surprising my busy mom, even if it meant dropping things from high places just to get her attention. My mom juggled taking care of me and my sibling along with all the household chores.

When I went to daycare, I spoke Tamil, but now I don't remember a word of it. My grandma would pick me up, and I'd demand candy before heading home, refusing to budge until I got what I wanted. My dad would also give in to my demands for toys, especially noisy ones like trucks and trains.

We moved to Bangalore when I was around 3 or 4 because of my dad's job. School became a bigger part of my life, and I'd cry when my mom dropped me off at first. But I was a good student and got along well with my teachers.

After moving to a new apartment, I struggled to make friends both at school and in the neighborhood. The language barrier made it hard to connect with others, but eventually, I found my place.

My parents encouraged me to explore music and art, which I struggled with at first but improved over time. I also became fascinated with computers, spending hours playing games and exploring the internet.

Unfortunately, my grades suffered because of my obsession with electronics. When my dad saw my grades dropping, he took away all my gadgets. Then, I got sick with chickenpox, which made me realize how vulnerable I was. It was a wake-up call for me to focus on my health and academics. I really had a turn-around in the level of maturity and focus on the things that actually mattered to me. I listened to my mother more, I wrote down goals for myself, tended to go out and play sports instead of gluing myself to the computer or TV. I eventually topped my class and was the best student in my class till the end of high school. I was the only person in my entire school that got through the first stage of NTSE (a prestigious science olympiad securing a rank of 21 in the state). I later got admission into an engineering college that was ranked amongst the top 10 in the country.   

 
Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
